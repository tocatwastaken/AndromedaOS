# AndromedaOS
Version 2026.2  
This is the source code to my WIP ComputerCraft OS!
# Getting Started
Note: This requires [Tom's Peripherals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/toms-peripherals)!  
Simply clone the repo to your computer to get started.
You can find your computer's drive in the folder (minecraft install)/saves/(world name)/computercraft/computer/(your computer id, can be found with the id command)  
If you don't see your computer, make a folder first and it should pop up!
